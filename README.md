# Portfolio 

## Welcome 

This repository represents my portfolio a space where I present who I am, what I build, and how I think as a developer. The goal of this portfolio is to tell my story through projects, design choices, and problem-solving examples in a clear and engaging way.

Rather than being just a list of works, this portfolio is designed as a **living showcase** that grows and evolves alongside my learning journey.
